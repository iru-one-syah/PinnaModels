# Pinna Models Collection

# Overview
In this repository, I extracted 10 pinna (ear) models from the IHA Database of Human Geometries. These models have been processed and optimized for 3D printing and subsequent silicone molding. Whether you’re a researcher, engineer, or hobbyist, these models are available for educational, and research use.
